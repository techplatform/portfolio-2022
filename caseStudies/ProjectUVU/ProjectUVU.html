        <div class="main-title">UVU First-Year Advising</div>
        <div class="body-text">The redesign of the first-year advising page was a really hard project to work on. It was daunting to me from the beginning but working this project with a group was much easier. Starting with we first asked our clients what they wanted their site to accomplish, what requirements should it fill as well as ask what changes they would NOT like to see made. It was important for us to know what components they wanted to keep and what components they were comfortable throwing out.</div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="subheader-text">Project Details</div>
          <div class="body-text">We started off by conducting several interviews asking the target audience what their journey was as they started their first year. We stuck to a couple of questions and asked handful of people each. This helped us come together with multiple answers to compare and plan what this site has to really accomplish.</div>
          <div class="body-text">This was a crucial part in this project. We had to figure how beneficial this site was for freshman students and how we can improve it for them since they were the target audience. </div>
          <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/ProjectUVU/P4 Case Study/advising-head.jpg">

          <div class="body-text">One of the testing procedures we as team did was the eye-tracking test. This test helped us find what components of the website the users were drawn to. It also helped us measure how often it would take them to find a certain part on the website.</div>
        
          <div class="body-text">After conducting test case interviews on the current site, we were able to find out what the site is capable of doing and build persona for the redesign. <br> Personas helped create the site centered around them and made it more applicable for the desired audience. </div>
          <div class="body-text">With three-four personas tested out, we were able to design meeting their standards and improve on the design as the semester went on.</div>
        
          <div class="body-text">One other crucial part that we decided to do as a team was to rename one the services offered by the advising cent. The “Trial Guide” was causing a lot of confusion and students often assumed it was hiking guide. <br> After the rename, our second round of testers were able to understand the meaning of it and thought it was very clever.</div>
         <image class="project-header-image" src="P4 Case Study/canvassuport.jpg">
          <div class="body-text">We also made changes to the advisor page. We made it possible for the students to be able to enter their last name and be directed to their advisor. From there, they would be able to access the professional page for more information.</div>
        
          <div class="body-text">There were still more improvements to be made. We took into account that although our site was getting the results we wanted, we were still missing a few kinks here and there, main one being illustrations! We needed to bring our site to life and add a few pictures here and there. We also decided to take down huge reading sections and re-phrase them for quick summaries. Accompanied by an icon to help entertain the user.</div>
          <div class="body-text">While working on this project with my team, I was able to learn more and improve my skill. Although it was really tough working with a large group, we had many ideas that we were able to in cooperate within this design. <br> In conclusion, I would like to say that our re-design was just enough for a change but also a sense of familiarity to keep the staff and the user feel comfortable.</div>
