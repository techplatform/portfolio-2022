        <div class="main-title">THE CHECK-IN APP</div>
        <div class="body-text">Check-In was designed to help people stay safe while still enjoying going out to your favorite food joints. It keeps tracks of the customers in the restaurant and updates users if it safe to go or come back a little late. The problem that I wanted to solve with this design was to keep the safety protocol when the whole world was in middle of the pandemic. As well as help people who have social anxiety and want to have a nice meal without being surrounded by a crowd.</div>
        <div class="body-text">As mentioned before the sole audience members for this app are those who are worried about their safety of being around other people. As well as people who are shy or have social anxiety can also take benefit from this app and be able to go out and enjoy themselves. Either with their friends or by themselves. </div>

        <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="subheader-text">Project Details</div>
          <div class="body-text">During this project, I was able to design everything starting with the layout to what colors to use. I was able to also design a logo that best fit the whole product. I wanted  the design to be very simple and dark which adds professionalism rather than it being childish. The font I used also incorporated the overall design feel that I planned for.  I did however had a hard time deciding if I wanted to do a solid color as a background or if I was to add some realism. In the end I went ahead and added in the picture that exemplified what the app is about.</div>

          <div class="body-text">The layout of this app allows to have two user accounts. One being the prospective customer and the other being the staff who will keep count of their customers. One of the bonus contents of this app is that it can show you, based on your location, the restaurants around you and display the number of customers on the top of the restaurants.</div>
        
          <div class="body-text"> As far as scopes and constraints go, the design and the idea were perfect to put into use. But it would only be working if the employee regular updates the amount of restaurant traffic they are receiving. </div>
         <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/Check-IN/images-Pokemon/5feb2c2f49aff.jpg">
          <div class="body-text"> The overall design was a great start to a good idea. It solved the problem of what everyone was dealing with mid-pandemic. This can definitely something that can be edited and grown into an actually app that notifies people how busy a food joint is before they go in. Whether that be for social distancing or social anxiety. </div>
