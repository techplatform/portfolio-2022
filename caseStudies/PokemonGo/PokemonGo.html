        <div class="main-title">Gotta Catch Em’ All!</div>
        <div class="body-text">The Pokemon project was a very fun project to accomplish with my newfound JavaScript skills. This project involved new CSS animations along with more ways to manipulate the array to get the information to make this project fun and interactive. </div>
        <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/PokemonGo/images-Pokemon/download.jpg">
      </div>

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="subheader-text">Project Details</div>
          <div class="body-text">Since this was a learning project, there was no ultimate goal. But there was a lot of new information that I gained from working on this project. There were moments when it would get frustrated with the code. But that only made me want to work on it harder and I was able to make it everything that I pictured. </div>
          <div class="body-text">The whole purpose of this website was for those who are interested in Pokemon and would like to spend some time looking over all the cards that the website has to offer. The website allows users to view the cards and also lets them call the character they want to see the card of. </div>
          <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/PokemonGo/images-Pokemon/pokemon-cards-worth-main.webp">

          <div class="body-text">Another component of this website is that it allows the user to create their pokemon card with its abilities and name. To create the card the user is asked a few questions about what their character is all about. Such as its name, abilities, height, weight, and hidden items. </div>
        
          <div class="body-text">With all the information, the card then is created with the desired characteristics. Although this won’t allow the user to create the visual for their character, it does give the chance for them to see the characteristics of their character and see the card along with the rest. </div>
         <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/PokemonGo/images-Pokemon/images.png">
          <div class="body-text">One of the constraints I had was time. This project was to be finished in three weeks. If there was more time, I would’ve loved to add more features such as animation noise and allow the user to visually create a pokemon for their card.</div>
        
          <div class="body-text">Overall there were a lot of learning opportunities, especially in the CSS document that allowed card animations and receiving more data from an array. This project helped me to learn to have patience with what I worked on and I  was able to work on something from start to finish. </div>
