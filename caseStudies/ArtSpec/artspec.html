        <div class="body-text">Art Specialists is a non-profit project that I decided to start during my freshman year. The website design was actually part of an assignment which helped me start. Sadly the idea did get cut due to time constrains and the obligations but the designing the website was definitely a great start to an amazing idea. This place is intended for special need people to come and get some relaxation and fun time doing art. To build such a place, first and foremost getting a site up and running would help a lot by attracting the right people. </div>
        <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/ArtSpec/images-Pokemon/download.jpg">

      <div id="project-details">
        <div class="project-details-content">
        <div class="subheader-text">Project Details</div>
          <div class="body-text">Problem that would be solved by this is the anxiety some special need people feel when they are not able to understand the world around them. This creates situation where they feel unhappy with people around them or are frustrated with themselves. With this in mind, letting them have a relative outflow would immensely improve their state of mind and make them feel happy</div>
          <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/ArtSpec/images-Pokemon/children-with-special-needs-1600x900.webp">

          <div class="body-text">A big thing to make this happen would be to have a platform where families can get information and sign their loved ones who struggle with specials needs up to be a part of this great organization. The website should hold all the information such as who they are and why they do this. Also, knowing a little about the staff that work there also create comfort for those who might be a bit nervous to join in. The website also includes donations links and sign up link for those who can help support what the organization does.</div>
        
          <div class="body-text"> In this project, I wanted it to look fun, so I used a lot bright colors and a lot of images to make it known who the website and the whole organization was built for.  I alone worked on this design project but hope to later on assemble a team to make the site really come alive. </div>
         <image class="project-header-image" src="/caseStudies/ArtSpec/images-Pokemon/Special-needs.jpg">
          <div class="body-text">  I also ended up creating a logo that symbolized a nurturing act which is what all of this is about. The logo was very simple to create and I really loved the meaning behind the story it was telling. I would like to improve on making the site a bit more readable, and maybe a little more spacious. It does look like all the information is thrown at the reader.  </div>
        
          <div class="body-text"> This project is definitely something that I hope to come back to when I have enough resources. Time and money were the main constraints to stating this. But when I do have the resources I would love reopen this design and upgrade it even more to make to inviting and running for the actual deal.</div>
